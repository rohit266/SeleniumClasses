Purpose - Design test cases in a systematic way

-IN TestNG we don't need main method, so create the class without Main() method. TestNg automaticaly excute the class

Advantages:-
- It generate very good html reports
-It gives lot of annotation.
-It priorities the test case or we can called sequence of running the test cases.
-Dependency feature(We can define dependency on test cases)
-Grouping the test cases
-Data Provider (We can run same test case multiple time with different set of data)

TestNG -  it is open source and it is available in JAR file

-This is also called Java unit testing framework.
-This is only used for Java as Java unit testing framework.
